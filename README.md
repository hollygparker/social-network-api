# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to create API routes to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data using mongoose with mongoDB. This assignment was fun to understand how all the files are correlated with each other and I feel like I have a better understanding. I was troubleshooting a lot toward the end but I understand it more in the long run.

# My Experience
I enjoyed creating the API routes for this app and practicing with Postman to utilize these routes. I especially liked the POST calls.
